Jupyter notebook, animations, python, matplotlib



Matplotlib's animation base class deals with the animation part. It provides a framework around which the animation functionality is built. There are two main interfaces to achieve that using:

* `FuncAnimation` Makes an animation by repeatedly calling a function func.

However,  out of the two, FuncAnimation is the most convenient one to use. You can read more about them in the documentation since we will only concern ourselves with the FuncAnimation tool.

## Requirements

Modules including 'numpy' and 'matplotlib' should be installed.
To save the animation on your system as mp4 or gif imagemagick](https://sourceforge.net/projects/imagemagick/files/) is required to be installed.
